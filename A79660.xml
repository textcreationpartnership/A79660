            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>OVRTEOVS READER As the cauſe of my firſt writing this paper was to ſatisfy the Counteſſe of Inſiquin, &amp; giue her not only the true ſenſe and meaning of S. Auſtin, but alſo the beleefe of all Orthodox Antiquity concerning the reall preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Chriſt in the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt: ſo the reaſon why I now publish it, is to informe thoſe of the truth, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture may haue heard of a conference which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152241:3"/> happened thereupon between my ſelfe and D. Iohn Cozens a Proteſtant miniſter. Which becauſe it is related by ſome of his friends with much partiality &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice to the truth, I am ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed by friends to publish it with all the moſt materiall circumſtances wherewith it was accompanyed, or which were the occaſion of it; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby it will appeare that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the grand Patriarke of all Proteſtant Congregations neuer ſpoke truer, then when ſpeaking of the Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Sacramentarian doctrine (which is the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the English preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reformation) he ſayd:<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Ioan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Herua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium Typo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> The Sacramentaries began their opinion with lyes, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152241:3"/> with lyes they defend it: this I ſay will appeare plainly by the following relation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Counteſſe of Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin being trobled at her Honorable Lords being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Roman Catholick, and vſing all the meanes she could to draw him to returne againe to Proteſtaniſme, among other indeauours, she applyed the induſtry of D. Io: Cozens a Protaſtant mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who to that effect wrot ſundry papers to him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein he impugned the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Bishop of Rome ouer the whole Church of Chriſt, as a doctrine crept-in ſince the Apoſtles tymes, and not warranted by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Orthodox Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:152241:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. Theſe papers the earle of Inſiquin was pleaſed to ſend vnto me, and withall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted me to returne an anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to them, eſpecially to the authorities alleadged therein out out of S. Gregory the great and S. Cyprian againſt our Catholick doctrine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In compliance with my Lords requeſt I drew a short anſwer, wherein I shewed firſt by the teſtimone of the Doctours owne brethren that his vrging of S. Gregories re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the title of vniuerſall Bishop is very vaine and idle and grounded vpon wilfull blindneſſe and Hereticall obſtinacy; becauſe it is clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then the ſunne, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the greateſt ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Proteſtant ſyde, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152241:4"/> S, Gregory, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the foreſayd obiection, did clayme and exerciſe the Primacy of authority and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction ouer all Churches in cauſes ſpirituall and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, and therefore he tearmeth the ſee of Rome the head of all Churches; the mother Church; the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe of Nations, and auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them to be peruerſe men that will not be ſubiect to her: and that S. Peter was by God appointed ouer all the Church &amp;c. Theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments are made of S. Gregory by Bale, Bulin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Melanchton, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiſts and other Proteſtant writers againſt D. Cozens and his old worne-out obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath beene ſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152241:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> many tymes already anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and refuted not only by our Catholick Diuines but euen by Proteſtants. In ſo much that Andreas Friccius, a Proteſtant, whom Peter Martyr ſtyleth an excellent learned man writeth thus in confutation of this foolish obiection ſaying:<note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>de Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>pa.</hi> 570.</note> Some there be &amp;c. that obiect the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Gregory, who ſaith that ſuch a title pertaineth to the Precurſor of Anti-Chriſt: but the reaſon of Gregory is to be knowne, and it may be gathered from his words which he repeateath in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Epiſtles, that the title of vniuerſall Bishop is contrary to and doth gainſay, the grace which is commonly poured vpon all Bishops. He
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152241:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> therefore that calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the only Bishop, taketh the Bishop like power from te reſt. Wherefore this title he would haue to be reiected &amp;c. But it is neuertheleſſe euident by other places, that <hi>Gregory thaught that the charge and Principality of the whole Church was committed to Peter.</hi> And yet for this cauſe Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory thought not that Peter was the forerunner of Anti-Chriſt. Thus Friccius. So euident it is by the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Proteſtant that S. Gregory himſelfe claymed and defended the Primacy of the Roman Bishop &amp; Church ouer all other Bishops and Churches whatſoeuer. And yet D. Cozens will be ſtill vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging againſt vs this obiection
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152241:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> of s. Greg: which proceeding doth euidently conuince him to be either extreme ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; little verſt euen in his owne authors; or elſe, (which is much worſe,) to haue layd a ſyde all shame and honeſty being reſolued to maintaine any thing though neuer ſo cleer againſt his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſo that he may for baſe ends and ſecular intereſt deceaue the vnlearned.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hauing shewed that his argument drawne from the authority of s. Gregory was of no credit euen with the learnedſt of his owne ſchoole I went on declaring how the miniſter abuſed S. Cyprian by diſiointing, clipping, and confounding S. Cyprians ſayings that ſo he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152241:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> his meaning, which are the ordinary shifts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant miniſters and are moſt vnexcuſable in D. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, becauſe he wilfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuers in it, notwithſtanding the notice which was lately taken thereof in the very ſelfe ſame controuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y by that learned Diuine Mr. Thomas Carre in his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionall diſcourſes, and in like occaſion by D. Thomas Vane in his vindication of the Councel of Latteran; both of them laying open his foul peruerting and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the fathers and the Councel to his eternall sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and confuſion: for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but appeare to euery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is not ſo much a louer of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152241:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> truth, as he would faine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to his followers, but rather to be accounted of the number of thoſe who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue darkeneſſe more then light falshood more then truth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Theſe hereticall ſlights being diſcouered, in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter I shewed how the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of S. Cyprian being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cited make moſt cleerly for our Catholick doctrine ſeing it is cleer that he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and taught that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church was by diuine inſtitution the Principall and chief Church; that she had the prerogatiue of being the mother Church of all other Churches; that the Primacy or head-gouerning authority was by Chriſt giuen to S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152241:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> and his ſucceſſor; and that his Chaire, that is, the ſee of Rome, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and head-ſpring from whence do flow all the ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of pure and infallible doctrine; is the ſunne from whence all the ſtarres of the firmament that is, all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches receiue the light of verity; is the Origen and Center of vnity, from whence do iſſue all the Lines of Power and iuriſdiction which goe to the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the Eccleaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Hierarchy.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Hauing returned this anſwer to my Lord of Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin; his Lady with in few dayes after ſent me another paper of her owne hand writing wherein she had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152241:8"/> out of ſome bookes of her owne ſome ſayings of S. Auſtin which she conceiued to make very cleerely againſt our Catholik doctrine of the Reall preſence of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, telling me wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thall that she had showne them to my Lord, and that he had ſayd that he could not well tell how they were to be vnderſtood, but that he did not doubt but that I could giue a ſatisfactory anſwer to them: which therefore she deſired of me, and with what ſpeed I could.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Heereupon for my ladyes ſatisfaction I drew the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing anſwer: wherein I firſt deliuer ſome generall Rules to be obſerued for the right vnderſtanding of S.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152241:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> Auſtine or any other of the ancient fathers in the matter of the H. Euchariſt. Then applying the ſayd Rules reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectiuely to the places obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of S. Auſtine I shew how they make nothing at all againſt our Catholick doctrine. This done, I proue by cleere places of S. Auſtin that his beleef was the ſame with ours concerning the reall preſence. And laſtly in further confirmation of our doctrine I adde the aggreing conſent of all Orthodox An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity deliuered by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of euery age from the dayes of S.

For vpon my coming to the Palais Royall to preſent this Anſwer to my Lady, I was by and by after conducted by my Lord from his owne lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to D.

After the common ſalutes of Ciuility, occaſion being giuen me, I told him the cauſe of my comming then to the Palais Royal was to bring my Lady an Anſwer which ſome three or foure dayes afore she had deſired of me to ſome authorities of S. Auſtin which &amp;c. The Doctor replyed, he knew not what she had done, and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it was, she had done it of her ſelfe &amp;c.</p>

            <p n="9">9. I replyed firſt that I cam not to diſpute about the meaning of Theodoret and Gelaſius, but to ſatisfy my

And then my lady shewed a deſire that it might be ſo, and ſayd she would reade my paper after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wars and willed me to anſwer to Theodoret and Gelaſius.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Heereupon I replyed to the Doctor and ſayd; firſt Gelaſius is not the man you take him to be: who is he then ſayd the Doctor? not Gelaſius the Pope, ſayd I, neither doth he whoſoeuer he be, make any thing againſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152241:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> vs, as you may ſee in Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.

            <p>Faith relyeth vpon autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and therefore in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith the greateſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority muſt command our beleefe and ſway our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: but the reſt of the fathers do euidently hold with vs, and their authority is incomparably greater, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore we are to ſubmit to it,

            <p n="14">14. Heere I was with much a do permitted to reade ſome authorities of the fathers. And the firſt I lighted on in turning to them, was this of S.

            <p n="15">15. The Doctour not loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as it ſeemes, for this authority and therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no anſwer or rather shift ready for it, cryes out, Gaudentius, who is this Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius? He is, ſayd I, a

            <p n="16">16. Heere becauſe the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour did not admitt S.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152241:25"/> deceiued by him, and rely vpon his word and doctrine in matters of faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. One is, that whereas I had vpon occaſion affirmed of Luther that he denyed S. Iames his Epiſtle to be the word of God, D. Cozens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed this of Luther with as much confidence as if he had had a face of braſſe. And yet there is nothing more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by thoſe of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſchoole then this, that Luther ſaies of S. Iames his Epiſtle that it is <hi>ſtraminea epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tola an epiſtle of ſtraw and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy altogether of an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall spirit.</hi> In which reſpect,<note place="margin">Luther in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tola.</note> In which reſpect, as alſo for other his horrible prophanings of Gods holy word,<note place="margin">L. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cram. fol. <hi>412.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Another argument of D. Cozens inconſtancy in his aſſertions, and confidence in impugning the knowne truth, is, that, after he had moſt boldly auouched that the doctrine of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and adoration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was neuer knowne nor practized in the Church before the Lattetan Councel, he preſently corrected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as if he had beene two fauourable towards the truth and not vttered a falshood lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152241:26"/> doctrine defined by the Councel, but afterwards by the Decree of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius the third. And yet there can be nothing more cleer then that the whole Councel did define the doctrine we ſpeake of. For it is one of the very firſt Heads or Articles of faith which the Councel doth define, beginning the Decrees with <hi>firmiter credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus &amp; ſimpliciter confitemur we firmely beleeue and plainly confeſſe &amp;c. that the true body and bloud of Christ is truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Sacrament of the Altar vnder the formes of bread and wine:</hi>

               <p>IN like manner the fathers do in a true &amp; Catholik ſenſe call the Euchariſt a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, a ſigne à figure of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152241:34"/> Chriſts body &amp; à remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of his paſſion. It is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, as. S.

The externall formes of bread &amp; wine are a ſigne of Chriſts true body &amp; blood contayned by way of foode vnder them. It is a figure and remembrance of Chriſts death &amp; paſſion, but to inferre from hence, as Proteſtant Miniſters do, ergo Chriſt is not there really preſent, is as idle as this, Herod made a ſupper in rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his birth day to the Chief of Gelilee; ergo he was not preſent at it.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152241:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> not vſe of the word in former tymes, proues only this, (which is a Confirmation of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,) that before the tyme of Berengarius, [the firſt that moued open warre againſt the B.

               <p>The third thing which the Councel of Trent doth declare and teſtify, is, that this doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of Tranſubſtantiation is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and orthodoxall, that is, is the ſame which the Paſtours and Doctors of the Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue with one accord beleueed &amp; taught as an Apoſtolicall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152241:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> as a doctrine of faith which the Apoſtles receiued from our bleſſed Sauiour deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to their ſucceſſors to be by them conuayed downe all along to Poſterity. The proof of this truth is the ſubiect of all that heere followes, and that I may more fully &amp; cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate it I make this argument.</p>

            <p>IF in replying to what is heere alleadged out of the fathers in proof of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of our doctrine, he will shew himſelfe a Doctour and ſpeake to the purpoſe; and not a Deceiuer vſing hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſlights and fallacies to deceaue the ignorant; let him firſt reflect on the ſtate of the queſtion which is heere between vs and Proteſtants; and let all he ſayes dir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctly tend to confute and diſproue that which we maintaine to be ancient and Orthodoxall againſt him &amp; all other ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do that oppoſe vs.</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:152241:90"/>
            <p>The Queſtion is in a matter of fact, to wit, wheter the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers (the Paſtors and Doctors of Gods Church,) did not beleeue and teach the ſame doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiation, which the now Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church doth beleeue &amp; teach; that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did not beleeue &amp; teach that in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt there is by Conſecration made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of the ſubſtance of the bread and wine into the body and bloud of our Lord, the outward formes of bread and wine ſtill remaining; which is the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, as the Councel of Trent aboue ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted §. 15. doth expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:152241:91"/>
            <p>This being the queſtion controuerted between vs and the Noueliſts of theſe tymes; we maintaine the affirmatiue, and auouch that the ancient holy fathers of all ages did with one accord beleeue and teach in this point, what the now Roman Church doth beleeue and teach; and in proof thereof we haue allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the teſtimonies which they giue both of their owne faith and of the faith of the whole Chriſtian world in their tymes; and that ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in as cleer and as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words, as the Councel of Trent it ſelfe doth deliuer the ſame; in words, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their proper and litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe, doe formally auouch a Conuerſion and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:152241:91"/> Change of the ſubſtance of the bread and wine into the body and bloud of our Lord; in words, which cannot wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout manifeſt violence, be wreſted into any other ſenſe, no more then the words of the Councel of Trent. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore the Doctour, if he will ſay any thing at all to the purpoſe in oppoſition to vs, muſt either bring a greater authority as plainely and as expreſly denying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting what the aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited fathers do affirme and teach, (which he will neuer be able to do, ſeing there can be no greater authority on earth then the vnanimous conſent of the fathers, and the teſtimony of the whole Catholick and vniuerſall
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:152241:92" rendition="simple:additions"/> Church;) or els he muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the fore alleadged teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies not to be the ſayings of thoſe fathers vnto whom they are aſcribed: which will be as hard for him to doe as the former: for he may as well deny that there were euer any ſuch men as thoſe fathers, as deny the cited bookes and authorities to be theirs.</p>
            <p>One of theſe two things the Doctor muſt neceſſarly performe to weaken our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion which maintaines the doctrine of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to haue beene beleeued and taught by the ancient Orthodox fathers of all ages. For what wiſe man will not diſpiſe and contemne as the foolish and idle conceipts of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:152241:92" rendition="simple:additions"/> Hereticks, the faigned gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the ſenſeleſſe expoſitions the violent and ſtrayned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions ſo manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the proper and litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe of the words and to the plaine meaning of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which Proteſtant mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters do frequently make of their ſayings when they are vrged againſt them as making cleerly on our ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in their plaine and litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe.</p>
            <p>As we haue cleerly ſtated our doctrine of faith concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Tranſubſtantiation, as it is propoſed by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Trent to all Chriſtians to be beleeued; and as we haue demonſtrated it by the full teſtimony of Orthodox Antiquity to haue euer beene
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:152241:93"/> beleeued and taught by the Paſtors and Doctors of the Church who did, all, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and expound in our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick ſenſe our Sauiour promiſe Io. 6. and the words of Inſtitution. So the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to cleere himſelfe and his Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t congregation from the note of innouation and damnable hereſy; muſt firſt ſet downe his doctrine cleerly not obſcurely; particularly, not confuſedly; in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as all may know what they are to beleeue in particu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar concerning our Sauiours being really preſent or not preſent in the Euchariſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly hauing cleerly particularized his doctrine, he muſt produce cleere teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Orthodox fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152241:93" rendition="simple:additions"/> of euery age from Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vp to the Apoſtles, which do formally auouch the ſayd Proteſtant doctrine, taking the words <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſignification, in the ſenſe which they do offer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly. Thirdly he muſt produce cleere Scripture, that is, Scripture which, taking the words in their plaine and litteral ſenſe, doth eſtablish that doctrine Scripture that is cleerly ſo expounded by the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hers of euery age vp to the Apoſtles Scripture, and that chiefly of the Inſtitution which doth affirme it formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and was alwayes ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the fathers.</p>
            <p>This we haue done in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our Catholick
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152241:94"/> doctrine: and this the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour muſt do for the eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of his opinion, Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he will neuer proue his doctrine to be ancient and <hi>Orthodoxall</hi> nor she him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a ſcholler, nor a louer of truth, nor free himſelfe from the note of hereſy, But this task he will neuer be able to performe ſolidly and truly, &amp; ſo as any man that is but meanly conuerſant in the fathers, may reſt ſat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, and therefore he will euer remaine guilty of the greuous ſinne of ſchiſme t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
